# The Space of Power: Mapping and Data as Political
# While many theorists look into the ways in which Big Data and mapping produce and reproduce particular epistemological understandings of the world (Boyd and Crawford, 2012; Crampton and Krygier, 2005), they also specify that there are potentialities in utilizing data visualization and spatial analysis tools critically. In responding to these arguments (Boyd and Crawford, 2012; Crampton and Krygier, 2005), my research focuses on examining whether maps are political and perpetuate particular senses of realities. In this project, I ask whether maps visualize certain political ideologies and what are the potential factors influencing the messages conveyed in maps.
